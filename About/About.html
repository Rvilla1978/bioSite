            <h3>
Aurelia Villarreal was born Aurelia Torres in 1957 in New Braunfels, Texas. She never graduated from high
school and married at 18 years old. She married Raymond Villarreal. They have three son’s Raymond Jr,
Robert, and Randy she also has three grandchildren Alexis, Austin, And Chelsea they are all children of
Raymond Jr. She has always been small, when her granddaughter Alexis was 12, she was the same
height. She took care of her three sons and worked; we never had much money but always seemed to
get by.
She said it was her faith that got her through the tough times. When my dad was in a car accident and
broke his leg, we could no longer know where we were staying. She says that was the hardest time in her
life, because we stayed with his mother and his sister’s, and they did not like her at all. She does not
have hobbies other than church and telenovelas. Currently she is seeing La Rosa de Guadalupe, Tierra De
Esperanza, and Marimar. Her church is very important to her. If she is too sick to go she watches a stream
on YouTube
