            <h2>Aurelia</h2>
			
            <h3><p>In August of 2013 Aurelia had a blister on her right foot it pop and she thought nothing of it. 
			A week later she was in the hospital her foot had become infected they needed to amputate her right leg. 
			They thought it best to amputate just below the knee after the surgery she was informed it was complications of diabetes.
			Further complications would occur at some points we did not think she was going to make it. 
			Not even a year after her husband died, we may have lost her too.
			In fact, her sisters, brother, and sons came to say goodbye her Pastor came and preyed every day.
			</p>
			<p>
			Aurelia's kidneys were failing. She was placed on dialysis three times a week and she slowly recovered.
			After six months she was released from the hospital into a rehabilitation center to learn to walk with a prosthesis.
			She spent four months in facility of Warm Springs rehabilitation center she was never able to walk without a walker.
			The next facility she went to was Colonial Manor Nursing home spending an additional three months in this facility.
			Finally, after over a year she was able to come home for the first three years when I was off she would be home with her son Robert.
 			On the days he worked she would stay at her sister Emma, or Hela depending on who could help her.
            </p>
			<p>
			When Robert bought a bigger home in 2017, she decided she wanted to stay home even when he is at work.
			Aurelia is also going blind, so I needed to figure out a way to make things easier for her to cook meals.
            I setup meals that can go in the air fryer I have taught her to use Alexa to set timers.
			She can easily make what I have put out for her. I also put water in the coffee maker every night.
